<p style="font-size: 1.3rem;"><strong>Hi! I'm JÃºlio, welcome to my page :)</strong></p>

<p>
I'm a physicist with a deep interest in how complex systems work and how their behavior can be understood through modeling and data analysis.
My passion for physics, combined with an early interest in music, led me to study the physics of acoustic instruments and, eventually, wood.  
The naturally complex and hierarchical structure of wood, along with its remarkable mechanical properties, sparked my fascination with materials science.  
Today, I combine experimental methods, simulations, modeling, and data analysis to investigate how structure relates to function in natural and engineered materials.
</p>

<p>
I enjoy exploring new methods, interdisciplinary perspectives, and scientific reasoning to enlighten the unknown and simplify the known.
