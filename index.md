# Julio Barros
**Data Scientist / Physicist**

I’m a physicist and data scientist working on micromechanics, modeling, and quantitative analysis of materials.  
I enjoy exploring the intersection between experimental data and computational methods — especially in biomaterials and wood mechanics.

📍 Based in Switzerland · Originally from Brazil 🇧🇷
